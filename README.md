# SmartPrice-Predictive-Modeling-and-Visualization-of-Housing-Markets
## Overview
This repository presents a final project developed for the *Big Data Visualization for Business Communications 01* (DSMM Group 1). The goal is to analyze housing market data to uncover key factors influencing property prices and develop predictive models using machine learning. The project also includes advanced visualizations using both Python and Power BI to support insightful, data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting housing prices is complex due to the multitude of influencing variables, such as location, size, and property features. This project addresses that challenge by:
- Identifying the most impactful factors on housing prices.
- Developing robust regression models to predict property values.
- Designing interactive dashboards for intuitive, stakeholder-friendly data presentation.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis and modeling.
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Revealing trends and patterns through visual techniques.
- **Machine Learning**: Training and evaluating multiple regression models.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Leveraging Power BI for dynamic visual storytelling.
- **Scalable Workflow**: Structured for future deployment and scalability.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Visualization
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning
- **Regression Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - ElasticNet Regression
- **Scaling**: MinMaxScaler
- **Visualization**: Power BI for interactive dashboards

## Techniques & Skills Applied
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like `Renovated` and `House Age`
- **Outlier Treatment**: Using Interquartile Range (IQR) to remove extreme values
- **EDA**: Analyzing distributions, correlations, and trends
- **Model Evaluation**: Measuring performance with RÂ² and RMSE

## Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Exploration**: Understanding the structure and key variables
2. **Data Cleaning**: Resolving inconsistencies and preparing clean inputs
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful new variables
4. **EDA**: Gaining insights through visual analysis
5. **Modeling**: Training and comparing regression models
6. **Visualization**: Building Power BI dashboards for stakeholder use

## Results & Impact
- Identified strong predictors of price, such as square footage, grade, and location
- Developed multiple regression models with solid RÂ² and RMSE scores
- Delivered interactive dashboards that enhance business communication and decision-making
